# Native Events on Casper 2.0

Reacting to and emitting smart contract events is an integral part of the blockchain experience. Events provide a way to notify off-chain applications of state-changes that took place on the blockchain. In Casper 1.x, contract-level events were not natively supported, and a workaround, known as the [Casper Event Standard](https://github.com/make-software/casper-event-standard) (CES) was created. The CES worked by creating a standardized structure with which developers could register their own events. Under the hood, the CES simply stored the event data in specialized dictionaries that server-side event streams could listen to. This works, but can be insecure if external, foreign contract(s) are called by the original contract, as there is no way to guarantee that the external contract didn't emit a message of its own.

In Casper 2.0, native contract-level events have been implemented under [CEP-88](https://github.com/casper-network/ceps/blob/master/text/0088-contract-level-messages.md). CEP-88 establishes a secure, one-way messaging channel between contracts and entities listening to a node's event stream. This standardized method of defining contract-level events is built right into the existing Casper event stream, making it automatically supported by Casper's SDKs.
